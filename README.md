This Application connects to Facebook (using supplied credentials) which then using Facebooks GraphAPI makes a request for various information form a users Facebook profile (such as the users liked pages). The application then displays these in a tablew view for the user to select while other profile information is used in other parts of the application. The user can then convert hexadecimal values to decmial values (and vice versa) with the results displyed on the paired Apple watch.
